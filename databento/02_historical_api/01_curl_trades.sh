# Fetch ES trades from Databento using curl (raw HTTP REST API).
#
# This does the same thing as 01_historical_sdk/02_get_trades.py,
# but using curl instead of the Python SDK.
#
# Usage:
#   export DATABENTO_API_KEY="db-..."
#   bash 01_curl_trades.sh

# "set" is a shell built-in that changes the behavior of the current shell.
# It toggles runtime options that control how the script executes.
# Use "-" to enable an option, "+" to disable it (e.g., set +e disables -e).
#
# -e: exit immediately if any command fails
# -u: treat unset variables as errors   
# -o pipefail: fail the pipeline if any command in it fails (not just the last)
set -euo pipefail

# Require API key in environment
export $(grep DATABENTO_API_KEY ../../.env)
# ":" is a shell no-op (do nothing). We need it because "${VAR:?message}" is a
# parameter expansion, not a standalone command—without ":", the shell would try
# to execute the *value* of the variable as a command. The ":" safely discards
# the expanded value while still triggering the :? check, which aborts with
# "message" if the variable is unset or empty.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# How to read the key fields:
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# TIMESTAMPS — Both ts_recv and ts_event are nanoseconds since 1970-01-01 UTC.
#   1722470400 seconds ≈ 2024-08-01 00:00:00 UTC (the start of our query window).
#   The fractional nanoseconds capture sub-microsecond precision.
#
# PRICE — Databento stores prices as fixed-point integers to avoid floating-point
#   rounding. Divide by 1e9 to get dollars:
#     5587750000000 * 1e-9 = $5,587.75 (ES futures price)
#     5587500000000 * 1e-9 = $5,587.50
#   The Python SDK does this conversion automatically.
#
# SIDE — The aggressor side of the trade:
#   "B" = a buy order hit a resting ask  (buyer aggressed)
#   "A" = a sell order hit a resting bid  (seller aggressed)
#
# SIZE — Contract quantity. ES trades in multiples of 1 contract
#   ($50 × index per contract).
#
# ts_in_delta — Nanoseconds between ts_event and ts_recv. Tells you
#   how long the message took to travel from the matching engine to
#   the feed handler (~14–15 μs in these records).
