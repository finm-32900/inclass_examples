\section{Introduction}

This is the introduction section. LaTeX automatically numbers sections for you.

Paragraphs are separated by blank lines. This is still part of the introduction,
but this sentence starts a new paragraph.

\section{Background}

Sections help organize your document. You can have as many as you need.

\subsection{A Subsection}

Subsections provide another level of organization. LaTeX numbers these too:
this one is numbered 2.1 because it's the first subsection of section 2.

\subsection{Another Subsection}

And this is subsection 2.2.

\section{Conclusion}

That's the basic structure of a LaTeX article!
