# Unit Tests

Unit testing ensures your code works as expected through automated tests. This tutorial covers two common approaches to writing unit tests in Python.

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `01_test_file/` | Standard approach: tests in a separate `test_*.py` file, run with `pytest` |
| `02_doctests/` | Doctests: tests embedded in docstrings, run with `pytest --doctest-modules` |
