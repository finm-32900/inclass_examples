# Python Imports and Packages

This directory contains progressive examples teaching how Python imports work: modules, packages, and common pitfalls.

## Examples

| Directory | Topic |
|-----------|-------|
| `01_simple_module` | Import a single `.py` file as a module |
| `02_package_directory` | Import a directory with `__init__.py` as a package |
| `03_name_shadowing` | How local files can shadow installed packages (`sys.path` ordering) |

Work through them in order.
